# stat-131-refresher

Hi, there! Good day.

Ok. This offline web-app was made to serve as a refresher for the upcoming STAT131 test. And it also may serve as a study guide for our colleagues who just joined us, because they are the ones I target and had in mind before embarking on creating this, so they be not oblivious of the topics herein but have a comprehension of them and fare well in the test to come for short is the time.

Also, if you don't fully/really understand this topic, I urge you to follow, carefully, through the explanations and elaborations and try to understand the concepts for thy profiting. ;)

PS: The contents of this app may be subject to mistakes, errors and flaws and that's why I now advise that you authenticate whatever you read herein with a good Stats Text or the recommended one. And please, send a message if in case you find or notice any errors. (Link to my Facebook on sign in page)

Alright. Godspeed. ;)

Don't forget to forward or share this web-app to any of your friends who offers or offer STAT131 and just resumed. You could be lending a helping hand. :)
