# stat-131-refresher
Hi, there! Good day. \n\nThis offline web-app was made to serve as a refresher for our upcoming STAT131 test. And it also may serve as a study guide for our mates that just joined us, because they are the ones I target and were the ones I had in mind before embarking on creating this so they be not oblivious of the topics herein but have a comprehension of them and fare well for short is the time. \n\nOk. Also, If you don't fully/really understand this topic, I urge you to follow, carefully, through the explanations and elaborations and try to understand the concepts for thy profiting. ;) \n\nPS: The contents of this app is subject to mistakes, errors and flaws and that's why I now advice that you authenticate whatever you read herein with a good Stats. Text or the recommended one. \n\nAlright. Godspeed. ;) \n\nDon't forget to forward this web-app to any of your friends who offers or offer STAT131 and just resumed. You could be lending a helping hand. :)
